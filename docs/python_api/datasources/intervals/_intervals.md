# List of Interaction and Interval-based Studies

In this section, we provide a list of studies that focus on interaction and interval-based investigations, shedding light on the intricate relationships between genetic elements and their functional implications.

1. **E2G (Gschwind et al., Nov 2023):**
   _Title:_ "An encyclopedia of enhancer-gene regulatory interactions in the human genome".
   This study comprises of a large, curated compendium of enhancer→gene links built by integrating multiple evidence types (epigenomic signals, 3D contacts, expression correlations, and CRISPR perturbations) across many biosamples. The resource reports confidence/score per enhancer–gene pair and is organised by biosample/cell type.

DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.09.563812

2. **EPIraction (Nurtdinov et al., Feb 2025):**
   _Title:_ "EPIraction - an atlas of candidate enhancer-gene interactions in human tissues and cell lines".
   This study is a genome-wide atlas of candidate enhancer–gene links inferred primarily from H3K27ac ChIP-seq (enhancer activity) integrated with Hi-C contact probabilities, scored per tissue/cell line—methodologically similar in spirit to ABC-style scoring.

DOI: 10.1101/2025.02.18.638885
